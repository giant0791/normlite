.. py:class:: CursorResult(cursor: normlite.notiondbapi.dbapi2.Cursor, result_columns: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None)

   Provide pythonic high level interface to result sets from SQL statements.

   This class is an adapter to the DBAPI cursor (see :class:`normlite.notiondbapi.dbapi2.Cursor`)
   representing state from the DBAPI cursor. It provides a high level API to
   access returned database rows as :class:`Row` objects.

   .. note::

      If a closed DBAPI cursor is passed to the init method, this cursor result automatically
      transitions to the closed state.

   .. versionchanged:: 0.7.0   This class now fully supports Notion property identifier as column ids.
       Additionally, the :meth:`close()` is now available to close the underlying DBAPI cursor.
       Therefore, all methods returning rows now check whether the cursor
       is closed and raise the :exc:`ResourceClosedError`.
       The attribute :attr:`CursorResult.return_rows` of closed cursor result always returns ``False``.

   .. versionchanged:: 0.5.0
       The fetcher methods now check that the cursor metadata returns row prior to execution.
       This ensures that no calls to ``None`` objects are issued.


   .. py:attribute:: _cursor

      The underlying DBAPI cursor.


   .. py:attribute:: _closed
      :value: False


      ``True`` if this cursor result is closed.


   .. py:property:: returns_rows
      :type: bool


      ``True`` if this :class:`CursorResult` returns zero or more rows.

      This attribute signals whether it is legal to call the methods: :meth:`CursorResult.fetchone()`,
      :meth:`fetchall()`, and :meth:`fetchmany()`.

      The truthness of this attribute is strictly in sync with whether the underlying DBAPI cursor
      had a :attr:`normlite.notiondbapi.dbapi2.Cursor.description`, which always indicates the presence
      of result columns.

      .. note::

         A cursor that returns zero rows (e.g. an empty sequence from :meth:`CursorResult.all()`)
         has still a :attr:`normlite.notiondbapi.dbapi2.Cursor.description`, if a row-returning
         statement was executed.

      .. versionadded:: 0.5.0

      :returns: ``True`` if this cursor result returns zero or more rows.
      :rtype: bool


   .. py:method:: __iter__() -> Iterator[Row]

      Provide an iterator for this cursor result.

      .. versionchanged:: 0.7.0   Raise :exc:`ResourceClosedError` if it was previously closed.
      .. versionadded:: 0.5.0

      :raises ResourceClosedError: If it was previously closed.

   .. py:method:: one() -> Row

      Return exactly one row or raise an exception.

      .. versionchanged:: 0.7.0   Raise :exc:`ResourceCloseError` if it was previously closed.
      .. versionadded:: 0.5.0

      :raises ResourceClosedError: If it was previously closed.
      :raises NoResultFound: If no row was found when one was required.

      :returns: The one row required.
      :rtype: Row



   .. py:method:: all() -> Sequence[Row]

      Return all rows in a sequence.

      This method closes the result set after invocation. Subsequent calls will return an empty sequence.

      .. versionadded:: 0.5.0

      :raises ResourceClosedError: If it was previously closed.

      Return the first row or ``None`` if no row is present.

      .. note:: This method closes the result set and discards remaining rows.

      .. versionchanged:: 0.7.0  Raise :exc:`ResourceClosedError` if it was previously closed.
      .. versionadded:: 0.5.0

      :rtype: Optional[Row]



   .. py:method:: fetchall() -> Sequence[Row]

      Synonim for :class:`CursorResult.all()` method.

      .. versionchanged:: 0.5.0
          This method has been refactored as a wrapper around :meth:`CursorResult.all()`.
          This ensures consistent behavior across synomin methods.

      :returns: The sequence of row objects. Empty sequence if the cursor result is closed.
      :rtype: Sequence[Row]



   .. py:method:: fetchmany() -> Sequence[Row]
      :abstractmethod:

          This method closes the underlying DBAPI cursor and manages the internal state.




   .. py:method:: _check_if_closed() -> None

   Prototype for new type of cursor result for handling multiple result sets.

   The :class:`CompositeCursorResult` is intended for use with results produced by a
   multi-statement transaction. In this case, multiple result sets are produced.
   This class introduces the :meth:`next_result()` method to advance to the next result set.

   .. versionadded:: 0.7.0

   .. warning:: Experimental, DON'T USE YET.


   .. py:attribute:: _dbapi_cursor


   .. py:attribute:: _current_result


   .. py:method:: next_result() -> bool

.. py:class:: Row(metadata: CursorResultMetaData, row_data: tuple)

   Provide pythonic high level interface to a single SQL database row.

   .. versionchanged:: 0.7.0
       :meth:`__getattr__()` has been added to provide access to row values with Python dot notation.

   .. versionchanged:: 0.5.0
       :class:`Row` has been significantly extended to provide iteratable capabilities
       and a mapping-sytle object to access the values of the columns returned in the row.



   .. py:attribute:: _metadata

      The metadata object to process raw rows.


   .. py:attribute:: _values

      Thew column values.


   .. py:method:: __getattr__(key: str) -> Any

      Provide access with dot notation to row values.



   .. py:method:: __getitem__(key_or_index: Union[str, int]) -> Any

      Provide keyed and indexed access to the row values.

      Providing this method enables row object to be iterated::

          >>> for value in row:
          ...     print(f"{value = }")
          value = '680dee41-b447-451d-9d36-c6eaff13fb45'
          value = False
          value = False
          value = 12345
          value = 'B'
          value = 'Isaac Newton'

      .. versionchanged:: 0.5.0
          Now, it supports both keyes and indexed access. Error handling is more
          robust and consistent.

      :param key_or_index: The value's key (column name) or index (column positional).
      :type key_or_index: Union[str, int]

      :raises IndexError: If index is out or range.
      :raises KeyError: If row has no column named ``key_or_index``.
      :raises TypeError: If the provided index is neither ``str`` (column name) or ``int`` (column index).

      :returns: The value for the column the key or index has been provided.
      :rtype: Any
