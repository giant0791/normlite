normlite.txmodel.transaction
============================

.. py:module:: normlite.txmodel.transaction

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Provide transaction management for Notion integrations.

   This module adds transaction management to Notion integrations. It enables multiple clients to
   concurrently perform changes while maintaining atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.
   It achieves this by implementing shared and exclusive locking mechanisms and isolation levels.

   .. warning:: This module is at a very early stage of proof-of-concept. Do not use it yet!









Module Contents
---------------

.. py:exception:: TransactionError

   Bases: :py:obj:`normlite.exceptions.NormliteError`


   Base exception class for all ``normlite`` exceptions.

   .. versionadded: 0.5.0


.. py:data:: LockMode

   Type for lock modes.

.. py:class:: TransactionState(*args, **kwds)

   Bases: :py:obj:`enum.Enum`


   Provide a transition state ``enum`` to describe the possible states of a transaction.


   .. py:attribute:: ACTIVE

      It is the first stage of any transaction when it has begun to execute.
      The execution of the transaction takes place in this state.


   .. py:attribute:: PARTIALLY_COMMITTED

      The transaction has finished its final operation,
      but the changes are still not saved to the database.


   .. py:attribute:: COMMITTED

      All the transaction-related operations have been executed successfully, i.e. data is saved
      into the database after the required manipulations in this state.
      This marks the successful completion of a transaction.


   .. py:attribute:: FAILED

      If any of the transaction-related operations cause an error during the active or
      partially committed state, further execution of the transaction is stopped and
      it is brought into a failed state.


   .. py:attribute:: ABORTED

      When the transaction is failed, it will attempt to either rollback the transaction
      in order to keep the database consistent. Upon successfull completion of the rollback,
      the transaction enters the aborted state.

      .. versionadded:: 0.6.0


.. py:exception:: AcquireLockFailed

   Bases: :py:obj:`Exception`


   Raised when an attempt to acquire a lock for a given resource fails.


.. py:class:: LockManager

   Track which transactions hold locks on which resources and enforce access rules.

   .. versionadded:: 0.6.0



   .. py:attribute:: locks
      :type:  Dict[str, List[Tuple[str, LockMode]]]


   .. py:method:: acquire(oid: str, tid: str, mode: LockMode) -> None

      Try to acquire a lock for the requested resource and for the requesting transaction.

      :param oid: The object id to be locked.
      :type oid: str
      :param tid: The id of the transaction requisting the lock.
      :type tid: str
      :param mode: The lock mode.
      :type mode: LockMode

      :raises AcquireLockFailed: If the lock request cannot be served.



   .. py:method:: release(tx_id: str) -> None

      Release all locks held by the requesting transaction.

      :param tid: The id of the requesting transaction.
      :type tid: str



.. py:class:: Transaction(tid: str, lock_manager: LockManager)

   Provide a context to holds a list of change operations, their lock requirements,
   and rollback logic.

   .. warning:: Initial implementation. UNSTABLE.

   .. versionadded:: 0.6.0



   .. py:attribute:: tid

      The unique transaction identifier (UUIDv4).


   .. py:attribute:: lock_manager

      The lock manager to ensure locking mechanisms.


   .. py:attribute:: operations
      :type:  List[Tuple[str, LockMode, normlite.txmodel.operations.Operation]]
      :value: []


      The list of operations to be committed/rollbacked in the context of this transaction.


   .. py:attribute:: state

      The transaction state.


   .. py:method:: add_change(resource_id: str, mode: LockMode, operation: normlite.txmodel.operations.Operation) -> None

      Add a change request in the context of this transactions.

      Transactions track the list of changes they have to perform.

      :param resource_id: The resource id subject of the change.
      :type resource_id: str
      :param mode: The requested locking mode.
      :type mode: LockMode
      :param operation: The operation to carry out the requested change.
      :type operation: Operation



   .. py:method:: commit() -> None

      Commit the transaction.

      :raises TransactionError: If this method is called on a transaction not in state active.



   .. py:method:: rollback() -> None

      Rollback the transaction.

      :raises TransactionError: If this method is called on a transaction in state aborted.



.. py:class:: TransactionManager

   Procure and coordinate transactions, lock acquisition, and lifecycle (start/commit/rollback).

   .. warning:: Initial implementation, UNSTABLE.

   .. versionadded:: 0.6.0



   .. py:attribute:: lock_manager

      The lock manager.


   .. py:attribute:: active_txs
      :type:  Dict[str, Transaction]

      The active transactions the manager orchestrates.


   .. py:method:: begin() -> Transaction

      Procure a new transaction.

      .. note:: The transaction manager is repsonsible to assign to each created transaction a unique id.

      :returns: A new transaction.
      :rtype: Transaction
